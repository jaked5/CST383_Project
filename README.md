## Predicting Medical Student Mental Health

### By: Jake Horne, Hamdan Syed, Justin Nguyen

This specific dataset looks at the mental health of medical students in Switzerland, and looks at the mental health of these students at the time of this study. We want to create a machine learning model that looks at the well being of a student, and determines the relationship of key characteristics (of our choosing) to determine the emotional state of these individuals. From there, we want to discen if their are charactersitics that telegraph whether an individual is more susceptible to declining mental health or burnout, and to find these signs early to provide assistance for these students to minimize the adverse effects. The following attributes are used to determine the mental well being of these medical students:

* id
* age
* year
* sex
* glang (mother tongue)
* part (partner)
* job
* stud_h (hours study/ week)
* health
* psyt (psychotherapy)
* jspe
* qcae_cog
* qcae_aff
* amsp
* erec_mean
* cesd
* stai_t
* mbi_ex
* mbi_cy
* mbi_ea

By utilizing patterns with these characteristics, we hope to more accurately determine whether a particular individual is going through emotional decline or burnout, since the sooner these results are determined, less invasive procedures can be performed and students can minimize the negative consequences of mental stress.
